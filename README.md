# MIT OCW 6.034 Fall 2010
#
# My greatest appreciation for all those involved in creating and maintaining the MIT OCW 6.034 Fall 2010 course.
# This includes Prof. Patrick Henry Winston (who, I must add, is an excellent lecturer) and all others involved.
# I in no way claim ownership for the assignment code as supplied; I merely solved the assignments like any other student would have.
